# madbox-game

This game has been tested on Windows 10 and Android devices.

**The time it took you to perform the exercise**

It took me 5 hours to finish this exercise. The last hour and a half I've been cleaning some code, documenting it and testing a little bit the game.

**The parts that were difficult for you and why**

The most difficult part for me was the begining of the project, the moment when I have to think of what I have to do and how. After that, the development has been very enjoyable.

**The parts you think you could do better and how**

The game needs some materials and better character animations to feel more alive and not a simple test game. Also I would try to use Navmesh agents and some AI technique to improve enemies results and hinder the game substantially. In terms of code, I would implement an FSM for the Player character and the Enemy in order to have a better code architecture.

**What you would do if you could go a step further on this game**

I would convert this game into an endless runner, adding coins and objects, and maybe some kind of dash movement dragging the finger from up to bottom of the screen. The objects that the player collects during the runs could be used in the following ones. 
With that, we would have a little bit more complex game with a fun progression, continuity and depth mechanics.

**What did you think**

I really enjoy this test and hope you love the results. Also, I think that I can be very resolutive under preassure and join a development games team very fast.
